Python Aminet Download Tool
---------------------------

This is a tool which downloads files from Aminet, and then transfers them over the 
tty using sz.

I prefer to use sz (ZMODEM) to transfer files to Amiga from Linux computer because 
it is much easier than configuring TCP/IP.

How To Set Up ZMODEM Linux to Amiga
-----------------------------------

On your Amiga computer, install NComm 3.06, the public keyfile, ReqTools.library, 
and xprzmodem.library:

http://aminet.net/comm/term/ncomm306.lha
http://aminet.net/comm/term/NComm306PubKey.lha
http://aminet.net/comm/term/XPRZ351.lha
http://aminet.net/util/libs/ReqToolsUsr.lha

On Linux install sz:

   sudo apt-get install lrzsz

On Linux start login on serial TTY. Copy ttyS0.conf to /etc/init and then:

   sudo service ttyS0 start

ttyS0.conf is set for baud rate of 57600 which is the maximum I could use reliably 
on A4000/030. You might need to adjust it lower on slower machines.

On Amiga start NComm and configure serial. You should get login prompt from Linux 
computer so log in. Now you can transfer any file from Linux to Amiga like:

   sz myfile.lha

How To Use Python Aminet Download Tool
--------------------------------------

Above is pretty easy way to get files onto Amiga but when it comes to Aminet we 
have to first download the file to Linux PC and then use sz to transfer it to 
Amiga. That's where PyADT comes in.

Start it up and you get a command line interface similar to a CLI FTP client. 
You can 'cd' and 'ls'. When you 'get' a file, sz will start automatically, 
causing NComm to download the file.

PyADT detects if you are running it on a serial terminal. If you run it in a 
normal shell window it will not attemp to launch sz. It will just download the 
file to the cache instead.

PyADT does not retrieve directory listings from the server every time. Instead it 
downloads the Gzip index of all files on Aminet when you first run it. This whole
index is loaded into memory at startup whch takes about 2 seconds. That makes 
it extremely fast. You can force to redownload the index with 'update' command.

Implement searching/sorting.
Implement displaying readmes.
